  <h1>Feeling Lonely</h1>

  <p>Hey my love,</p>

  <p>I’m really sorry you’re feeling lonely right now.  
  I know that loneliness can sneak up on you even when you’re surrounded by people… and being so far away from each other doesn’t make it any easier.</p>

  <p>But baby, <br>
  <strong>You’re not alone. Not even for a second.</strong></p>

  <p>Even with the time zones, the distance, the oceans between us and the miles between us, my heart is always right there with you. I think about you constantly. I care about you deeply. When you feel alone, I want you to imagine me sitting right beside you, holding your hand, letting you rest your head on my shoulder.</p>

  <p>I know that sometimes the world feels different… and you feel like you’re standing in the middle of it with no one to turn to. But I’m right here. I’m one message away. One call away. One heartbeat away. And I’ll never ignore you or leave you to face things by yourself.</p>

  <p>You deserve to feel seen. To feel loved. To feel held.  
  And even though I’m not physically there yet, I promise you, you’re wrapped in my love all the time.</p>

  <p>Whenever you feel lonely, come back to this page, okay?  
  Let these words remind you that I care about you more than anything.  
  That you matter to me.  
  That you’re my favorite person.</p>

  <p><strong>You’re never truly alone, you have me, always, my baby.</strong></p>
