  <h1>Feeling Down</h1>

  <p>Hey my love,</p>

  <p>I’m sorry you’re feeling down right now. I wish I could just teleport there, pull you into my arms, hold you tight, and remind you how safe you are with me. I know things get heavy for you sometimes, And I know your heart gets tired because you care so deeply.</p>

  <p>But listen:<br>
  <strong>You are not alone. Not now, not ever.</strong><br>
  Even from across the world, I’m right here with you. Your feelings matter to me. Your heart matters to me. <em>You</em> matter to me more than you even realize.</p>

  <p>If today feels too much, just take a deep breath, go to discord, and message me.  
  And <strong>ALWAYS</strong> remember:  
  You don’t have to be strong all the time.  
  You don’t have to pretend.  
  You don’t have to carry everything by yourself.</p>

  <p>Whenever you feel low, lean on me. Tell me what’s hurting. Let me hold you through it, the same way you hold me when I fall apart. You don’t need to hide anything from me, not your sadness, not your stress, not your fears. I’ll take all of it, gently, patiently, with love. We will go through it together.</p>

  <p>You’re allowed to have bad days. You’re allowed to feel things deeply.  
  And you’re still the queen I love with my entire heart.</p>

  <p><strong>You’ll be okay, baby. I promise.</strong></p>
