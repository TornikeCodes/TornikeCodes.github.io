  <h1>Stressed</h1>

  <p>Baby… I’m really sorry your mind feels heavy right now.  
  I know how hard you try, how much you carry quietly, how much pressure you put on yourself, sometimes only to benefit others.  
  You always want to do everything right, to make everyone happy, to stay strong even when you're exhausted.</p>

  <p>But listen baby, </p>

  <p><strong>You don’t have to hold everything together on your own.</strong><br>
  You don’t have to pretend you're okay.  
  You don’t have to be strong every second of every day.  
  It’s okay to slow down. It’s okay to breathe.  
  It’s okay to let someone take care of you for once.
  <strong>Not with me.</strong></p>

  <p>I wish I could sit behind you right now, wrap my arms around your waist, press my cheek against your shoulder, and just let you exist.  
  No noise, no pressure, no work, no expectations, just you and me, calming down together.</p>

  <p>You’re allowed to rest, my love.  
  You’re allowed to pause.  
  You’re allowed to ask for help, even if you think it’s small.</p>

  <p>If things start feeling too loud in your head, come to me. Talk to me. Vent to me. Even if it’s messy, even if it’s confusing, even if you feel like it’s “nothing.”  
  If it matters to you, it matters to me.</p>

  <p>You are not alone in this. I’m with you through every stress, and every worry.</p>

  <p><strong>Come on baby, you've got this… and I’ve got you.</strong></p>
