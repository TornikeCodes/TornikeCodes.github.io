  <h1>Overwhelmed</h1>

  <p>My love,</p>

  <p>I know everything might feel too much right now, like the world is piling responsibilities on you, or you feel like you are handing too much at once, and your heart can’t catch a break. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed. You’re human, and you care so deeply, which is why it feel overwhelming so hard.</p>

  <p>You don’t have to handle everything at once. You don’t have to solve everything today. You don’t have to be perfect.</p>

  <p>Lean on me. Tell me what’s weighing on your heart, even if it’s messy. Even if it feels too small or too big, it matters to me because it matters to you. I’m right here with you through all of it, holding your heart steady when it shakes.</p>

  <p>You are not alone. The weight you feel doesn’t make you weak, it makes you human, it makes you the pretty queen I love through all of it, every heavy, messy, beautiful part of you.</p>

  <p><strong>Take a breath, baby. One thing at a time. You’ve got me, give me an opportunity to help.</strong></p>
