[00:00]It’s 11:59, your hand in mine
[00:04]The world is quiet, but my heart’s alive
[00:07]No fireworks, no flashing lights
[00:11]Just you and me in this midnight sky
[00:14]I never knew love could feel this calm
[00:18]Like winter air but somehow warm
[00:21]Every second I’m next to you
[00:23]Feels like I’m right where I belong
[00:29]And if the clock froze right here
[00:33]I’d still have everything
[00:36]‘Cause loving you, my dear
[00:40]Is more than just a dream
[00:45]So here’s my heart, it’s yours tonight
[00:48]No fancy words, just something right
[00:52]If love’s a choice, I choose you
[00:55]Over and over like I always do
[00:59]It’s Valentine’s, but truthfully
[01:02]Every day feels the same to me
[01:05]When I’m with you, time feels new
[01:09]11:59… just me and you
[01:15]“Wait… don’t move… listen.”
[01:26]It’s 12:00 — the world just changed
[01:29]Same sky above but you’ve got a new day
[01:33]And I’m the luckiest person alive
[01:36]‘Cause I get to stand right by your side
[01:40]Today’s not just about candles and cake
[01:43]It’s about the smile that you bring every day
[01:47]The way you laugh, the way you care
[01:50]The way you make everything feel safe
[01:54]You’re not just someone I love
[01:58]You’re someone I admire
[02:02]You shine without even trying
[02:05]You’re my quiet fire
[02:10]Happy birthday, my favorite soul
[02:12]You make broken days feel whole
[02:15]If I could give you anything
[02:19]It’d be the world on a silver string
[02:23]But since I can’t, I’ll promise this
[02:25]Through every doubt, through every risk
[02:29]I’ll be right here, whatever we do
[02:36]and it’s still you
[02:38]From Valentine’s into your day
[02:41]From yesterday into always
[02:45]If midnight proves anything
[02:47]It’s that I’d choose you in everything
[02:57]Still you.
